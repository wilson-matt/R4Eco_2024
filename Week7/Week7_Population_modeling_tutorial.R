?bactgrowth
# Most important for us, these data include bacterial strain, density, and antibiotic concentration (Tetracycline) through time.
# The following lines will process these data to structure them to be read by the all_growthmodels() function.
# This pre-processing of the data follows the example from ?all_growthmodels:
splitted.data <- multisplit(value ~ time | strain + conc + replicate,
                            data = bactgrowth)
  # Show which experiments are in splitted.data
names(splitted.data)
  # Get table from single experiment
dat <- splitted.data[["D:0:1"]]
fit0 <- fit_spline(dat$time, dat$value)
fit1 <- all_splines(value ~ time | strain + conc + replicate,
                    data = bactgrowth, spar = 0.5)
  # These examples require some CPU power and may take a bit longer
  # Initial parameters
p <- c(coef(fit0), K = max(dat$value))
  # avoid negative parameters
lower = c(y0 = 0, mumax = 0, K = 0)
  # Fit all models
  # This allows also to fit to the 'global' data set or any subsets

# Now we will look at the population growth models for all strains.
all_mods <- all_growthmodels(
  value ~ grow_logistic(time, parms) | strain + conc,
  data = bactgrowth, p = p, lower = lower, ncores = 2)
plot(all_mods)
  #Notice that you can scan through the plots and generate them all at once? 
  #This has to do with the data structure we will get to in the next step.

# But what if we only want to look at just a few strains?
# Based on the plotted model results let's look at R:250, T:125, R:125, D:62.5, D:1.95, and T:0.24

# Extract the observations from the model fits - this is an "S4" object. We have only worked with "S3" objects so far.
  # S4 allows for a more complicated data structure that is pre-defined and creates "slots" for objects within the listed larger object.
  # These are called with the "@" symbol instead of a "$". 
  # We can use the slot() function to subset the object.
fits_slot <- slot(all_mods, "fits")
subset_obs <- slot(fits_slot$`R:250`, "obs")

# Or you can call the vector, data frame, or other info directly through a combo of "@" and "$" depending on the object structure.
# In our case it's extra complicated and includes a nested S4 object, hence the two @ symbols.
  # This will give you the same result as the slot() function from above.
R250_obs <- all_mods@fits$`R:250`@obs

# You can confirm if they match through a quick logical:
table(subset_obs==R250_obs)
  # Check the output - all 124 values are "TRUE" so these two operations are performing the same function.

# You can also call the slot directly inside of a plot:
plot(all_mods@fits$`R:250`@obs) 


# To look at all 6 plots we are interested in we'll create a multipanel plot. 
# This use of par() will plot 2 rows with 3 plots in each row:
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
plot(all_mods@fits$`R:250`@obs)
plot(all_mods@fits$`T:125`@obs)
plot(all_mods@fits$`R:125`@obs)
plot(all_mods@fits$`D:62.5`@obs)
plot(all_mods@fits$`D:1.95`@obs)
plot(all_mods@fits$`D:0.24`@obs)

# Notice the different patterns in population growth for each of these?
# Can you think of anything that might be related to these differences from the dataset?
    # Think about the anibiotic concentrations.

# And notice the values of the y-axis - they differ by plot.
# We will fix the y-axis height to be consistent across all plots now for comparison.

par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
plot(all_mods@fits$`R:250`@obs, ylim = c(0.01,0.09))
plot(all_mods@fits$`T:125`@obs, ylim = c(0.01,0.09))

plot(all_mods@fits$`D:0.24`@obs, ylim = c(0.01,0.09))

# Revisit the antibiotic question: now we can quickly see these strains grow at different rates and have differing responses to antibiotics.
  # This response is not unlike a predator-prey relationship.

# Competitive interactions ####
# Competitive interactions can be modeled with a similar pair of L-V equations.
# The compLV() function from the EcoVirtual package will display model outputs of these equations.
library(EcoVirtual)

#First look at ?compLV to get a handle on what is happening here. 
?compLV
#There are 9 parameters that can be changed in the model

  # n01   =  initial population for the superior competitor species.
  # n02	  =  initial population for the inferior competitor species.
  # tmax	=  maximum simulation time.
  # r1    =  intrinsic growth rate for the superior competitor species.
  # r2    =  intrinsic growth rate for the inferior competitor species.
  # k1	  =  carrying capacity for the superior competitor species.
  # k2    =  carrying capacity for the inferior competitor species.
  # alfa	=  alpha coefficient.
  # beta	=  beta coefficient

# Each run of the model will create a viewing window with the population growth and isoclines.

# First run with the default values to view the output:
compLV(n01=10, n02=10,r1=0.05, r2=0.03, k1=80, k2=50, alfa=1.2, beta=0.5, tmax=200)


# What if we make species 2 a better competitor? 
  # I've also increase tmax to give the interaction more time to play out.

  # Now species 2 'wins' if given enough time

# What if species two goes back to being a weak competitor but has a much larger initial population? Say, 10x sp1?
  # This takes even longer to reach an equilibrium.
compLV(n01=10, n02=100,r1=0.05, r2=0.03, k1=80, k2=50, alfa=1.2, beta=0.5, tmax=600)
  # Notice the initial dip in species 1 numbers? This was a large enough population to temporarily out-compete species 1.

# If 10x the population of sp2 could temporarily win, what about 50x?
compLV(n01=10, n02=500,r1=0.05, r2=0.03, k1=80, k2=50, alfa=1.2, beta=0.5, tmax=800)
  # Sp1 still recovers eventually, but it's a much longer time scale.

# What about 100x?!?

  # We can see this time that sp1 still eventually wins, but the process occurs on a much longer time scale.


# Adjusting these parameters to model natural patterns is one way to begin generating questions,
  # and think through potential mechanisms, surrounding dynamics of real populations.

# In this week's assignment you use trial and error to identify potential causes of a predator-prey relationship
  # from real plankton population data.
