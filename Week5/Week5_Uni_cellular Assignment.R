# First, recreate Figure 4 from Herron et al. (2019). De novo origins of multicellularity in response to predation. Scientific reports.
  # Search datadryad.org by the paper title and download the dataset. It will include .csv files and R scripts, organized by figure.
  # Save the script and change the working directory on lines 8 and 115 to match your computer
  # Upload the plot you've created to GitHub. (4 points)
  # Zoom into your plot to look at the distribution for different strains.

# Do all of the strains in the plot have the same distributions (yes/no)? (1 pt)

# Based on these observations of your strain distributions, why did the authors use a Kruskal-Wallis test rather than ANOVA to compare the strains? (3 pts)


# Use the fitdist() and gofstat() functions to compare the poisson, negative binomial, and logistic distributions for:
  # (1) - The number of cells of progeny (data$Num.Cells.Progeny)
  # (2) - The replication time (data$RepTime.sec)
    #HINT- "Num.Cells.Progeny" has defined breaks. To display results, use the formula with the "chisqbreaks" argument as follows:
      #gofstat(list(fit.1, fit.2, fit.3, etc), chisqbreaks=c(1,2,4,8,16,32,64))


# Based on the AIC scores, which distribution is the best fit for: (5 pts each)
  # (1) - The number of cells of progeny (data$Num.Cells.Progeny)?
  # (2) - The replication time (data$RepTime.sec)?


# Plot a generic histogram for the replication time (data$RepTime.sec) (4 pt)

# Based on the patterns of this histograms and Figure 4:
  #Give one hypothesis for an evolutionary process represented by the two tallest bars in your histogram. (8 pts)
  # Don't cheat by looking at the paper! 
    # This hypothesis does not need to be correct - it only needs to be ecologically rational based these two figures.
