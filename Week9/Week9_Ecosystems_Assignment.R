# For this week it's time to start exploring your own ideas and questions in R.
  # There are at least five options in the dataset to create the following comparisons.

# (Q1 - 12 pts) Use the dataset from the tutorial to complete one redundancy analysis (RDA) with variance partitioning on a different community (NOT the nematodes).
  # Explain the ecological importance of your significant predictor variables, or the importance if none are significant for your community.

# (Q2 - 12 pts) Then use the dataset from the tutorial to create a linear model related to your RDA. Try multiple predictors to find the best fit model.
  # Explain the ecological importance of the significant predictors, or lack of significant predictors.

# (Q3 - 6 pts) Provide a 3-4 sentence synthesis of how these results relate to one another and the value of considering both together for interpreting biotic-abiotic interactions.
