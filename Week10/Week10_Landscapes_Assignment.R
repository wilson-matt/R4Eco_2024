#We looked at brook trout population demographics in relationship to water quality and stream flashiness.


#1: Give two specific conclusions you can make from these patterns. (4 pts)


#2: Rerun this analysis with either (a) a different metric of brook trout populations or a different species from the database. (6 pts)


#3: How do the results of your analysis compare to the vignette? (5 pts)



#4: For your final project you'll need to find two separate data sources to combine similar to the process here.
  #In prep for that, find one data source to compare with either the data in dbfishR OR DataRetrieval. (5 pts)
  #Read data from that source into your script. (5 pts)
  #Create any analysis of your choice that combines the two data sources, this can be as simple as a linear model. (5 pts)
